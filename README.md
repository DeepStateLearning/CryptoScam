# CryptoScam

I've been using the twitter API to try and nab some of those annoying bots.   Unfortunately, twitter thinks I'm the bot.  
In any case, I have one app that checks replies to certain crypto players and then compares the image using a simple metric on the images. 
There's another one, which is much easier, which simply involves searching a phrases all the scammers are using, and then reporting that account. 

This requires a config file in the directory with a working API Key.
